## Contributing Guidelines

- Follow proper Java style conventions. Use a style checker if
your IDE supports it.

- Search to see if your issue already exists.

- Create a pull request or issue, whichever makes sense.

- If your contribution adds functionality, fixes a bug, or 
makes something more simple, it will probably be merged.
