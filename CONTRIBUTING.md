## Contributing Guidelines

  - Follow proper Java style conventions. Use a style checker if
your IDE supports it. I tend to personally prefer the "Sun Checks" style 
as it's implemented in IntelliJ IDEA's CheckStyle.

  - Search to see if your issue already exists.

  - Create a pull request or issue, whichever makes sense.

  - If your contribution adds functionality, fixes a bug, or 
makes something more simple, it will probably be merged.
